In the To-Do app, we will have many different components. We will have a component for the adding task bar, which will include a form tag in HTML. We will also need a component for the search task bar, which will also include a form tag in HTML. The adding task bar will have to add the task to an array of tasks, while the search task bar will filter the tasks. The main component will be the list of tasks, which will iterate through the array to display the tasks in an unordered list (using props to create each element). Each task will need a done button when pressed either deletes the task from the tasks array or filters out the task. The data flow will mainly start from the two forms, and thus the array to be displayed will be updated with each press. In addition, deleting the class will also need to update the array to be displayed. 

Moreover, in the filter for the search, we need to create a buffer array that will display the filtered searches from the search bar. If this array is empty, we’ll need to display “No results found.” In addition, when we delete tasks from the array, we need to do so based on the individual states of each task. We could perhaps have a key “completed” that would be default false. On click for the “done” button, then the “completed” key would be true and then the task would no longer be shown in tasks.
